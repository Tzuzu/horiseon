## Description

This website was built in order to help Horiseon's website be more accessible, as well as cleaning up code to make it simpler to read.

- The motivation behind this project was to simplify the code, as well as to fix bugs with the current site
- This project solves many issues with the website, such as having proper navigation in the header, images having
alt text, as well as giving every non-semantic element a semantic tag, thus making the CSS able to be sized down and simplified.
- I've learned through this project that the benefits of using a semantic tag allows code to be simplified as well as making it easier to keep organized when working on both the HTML and the CSS
